# Contributing to GraphLens

First off, thank you for using GraphLens and for taking the time to contribute to the WebDev community! 🙏🎉

**GraphLens is proprietary closed-source software.**
While the source code of the extension is not available for public modification, we highly value the feedback, bug reports, and feature requests from our users to help shape the future of the product.

This repository is primarily used for **documentation** and **issue tracking**.


## 👋 How Can You Contribute?

Since direct code contributions to the extension logic are not possible, here is how you can help:

### 1. Reporting Bugs 🐛

If you encounter unexpected behavior or errors, please submit a bug report.

-   **Explore First:** Check the [Issues](https://github.com/GraphLens/graphlens/issues) to avoid duplicates and review the [Current limitations](https://github.com/GraphLens/graphlens?tab=readme-ov-file#4-current-limitations) section in the README.
-   **Use the Template:** Open a new issue and select the **Bug Report** template.
-   **Be Specific:** Provide reproduction steps, logs, and context.
-   **Privacy:** Ensure any code snippets or screenshots are anonymized and contain no sensitive data.

### 2. Requesting Features 💡

Have an idea how to make GraphLens better?

-   Open a new issue and select the **Feature Request** template.

### 3. Improving Documentation 📖

If you find a typo or an unclear section in the public documentation (README, Wiki), you are welcome to submit a Pull Request to fix just the documentation files.

### 4. Support the Project ⭐

Since this is a closed-source project, one of the most impactful ways you can contribute is by sharing your experience.

If you find GraphLens useful, please consider **leaving a review**. High ratings help other developers discover the tool and motivate us to keep shipping updates!
